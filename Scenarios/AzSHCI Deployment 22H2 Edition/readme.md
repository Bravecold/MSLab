## Notes:
* Notice AllowedVLANs in labconfig (to simulate VLANs configuration in NetATC)
* CreateParentDisk will create VHD with name AzSHCI**21**H2_G2.vhdx even with 22h2 media. Please rename VHDx manually
* Make sure you use latest 22H2 cumulative update (at least version 20348.1070 - september preview CU) as there are new cluster parameters (not yet used in lab), but it might be useful
